Even shortened 4 words it seems so very long, also need a proper name for it, 
may be experimenting around with it.

## Info 
### General
I (Fordola) really like Yugioh, but am not a fan of the entire "Win a duel before letting
the opponent have even 1 turn", so I generally don't play online.
I play various Yugioh games, but after hundreds of times beating the same opponents after 
**choosing** them, it just feels a bit repetitive, no challenge whatsoever.

I did play that "Duel Links" game, while I really dislike the **Speed Duels**, as they 
generally remove the mid-duel tactics from Yugioh and only aim at winning within turn 1-2,
"Duel Links" also has a lot of great ideas in it, like random no-name side duelists you can 
battle whenever you want, a lot of randomization to that game.

As someone who generally loves playing randomizers, 
whether it's Final Fantasy, Hollow Knight or other things, 
randomizers bring games to life a lot more, they allow almost endless replayability.

This randomizer Aims to give endless replayability to 
**Yugioh - Legacy of the duelist - Link Evolution** by randomizing the game.

## Card Type Balance
A deck has 40-60 cards, for this example we use 40 though.

In a deck of 40 cards, the amount of monsters should be around 20. 
Whether they are Effect cards or Normal ones, should not matter, unless it's cards that 
have requirements to be summoned.
The other 20 cards can be divided between Spell and Trap cards, it's generally said 
it's best to have a roughly even number of both.

## Card Level Balance

### General
Levels go from 1 to 12.

Level 4 and lower can be used freely, therefore they should be the main monsters 
in the deck.

Level 5+ cards can only be used with tributes, therefore they should be limited.

Level 5-6 require 1 tribute, are easier to summon.
Level 7+ require 2 tributes, they are often harder to summon unless with 
specific decks.

### Balancing
Out of the previously mentioned 20 Monster cards, most should be summonable easily,
as it's really easy to have a bad hand at the start of a duel.
20 Monsters = 15(?) Level 1-4 Monsters, 5 Level 5+ Monsters.

## Other types of Monster Cards
There are Effect, Fusion, Ritual, Xyz, Synchro and Pendulum cards.

Effect monsters are the most common ones, they could have simple effects or very complicated
ones, it's hard to say how to balance those.
There are some low level effect monsters that require special means to summon them.

Fusion monsters require some kind of Fusion spell card, there is the very known 
"Polymerisation" (probably missspellt), but also various others, which I don't know too well.
Fusions are often made of 2 monsters, but at times can have 3.
Fusion monsters go in the extra-deck.

Ritual cards are basically tribute requiring cards, BUT they require a spell card in 
order to be able to use the tributes in the first place. 
Both the Ritual card AND the Ritual spellcard go in the main-deck.

Xyz cards are pure chaos, they are a big reason why Yugioh duels these days 
can be won within turn 1. I don't know much about those really, except that they require 
multiple monsters of specific levels or types, to be summoned. 
Generally I think, if a Xyz Monster is Fiend type, then it probably requires 
Fiend monsters as tribute.
Xyz cards go into the side-deck.

Synchro ....?

Pendulum ....?

Yea, I have no clue at all about those 2.

## Monster Type and Attribute Balance

Many spells, traps and effect monsters target a specific type or attribute of monsters 
on the field, whether buff or debuff.
So generally speaking, it would be wise to put Field Spells that target Fairies, together with 
Fairy monsters in the same deck. 
There are many Monster Effects which target specific types or attributes too.
Ex. The known Harpy Deck has one of the Harpy monsters increase the ATK of 
all Winged-Beast monsters on ones own field side.

Balancing Spells/Effects that target specific Types or Attributes, may get a little hard 
and may take time.
Generally just place a bunch of same-colored (type or attribute) cards together in a deck.

## Important Card Types and Cards
In a balanced randomization, it could be important to add cards to draw more cards, 
destroy monsters, spells or traps.
There is various cards which are almost always in a deck, maybe add a chance to add those 
cards into the deck.
I think a list of "trap destroyers", "monster destroyers" and "hand destroyers" 
would be good.

A list of viable cards for this would be included in a different text.

## Thoughts

This one doesn't have to be **exactly those numbers** just a rough guideline. 
It **IS** possible to build good decks with only 10 (or even 5) monsters in it, but for a randomizer 
I feel like this would be very uncommon.

### 40-60 Cards per deck 

### = 50% Monsters
In a deck of 40 cards
= 15 Normal/Effect Monsters + 5 Tribute Requiring/Ritual Monsters

### 50% Spell/Trap cards
In a deck of 40
= 10 Spells + 10 Traps (Include ritual/fusion spell if needed)

### Extra deck?
IF "Red eyes black dragon" + "Summoned skull" are in deck 
= add "Red eyes Skull Dragon" (or something like that) to side deck

Xzy cards generally based on the same type/attribute as the cards in the deck.

### Card Limit
There are some cards that are banned, only allowed once/twice, but enemy decks in the 
game usually don't care about such rules, however the starter deck may need rules 
to be able to be used against enemies.
Every other card in the game has a limit of 3, no exceptions.

## Randomizing options?

1. **Full random** 
- With the usual 20-10-10.
2. **Type/Attribute decks** 
- Maybe one that has DARK monsters, one with Fairy, etc.
3. **Add Complete preset decks** 
- Self build or taken from the og game, loaded from a folder.
4. **A way to exclude/include Xyz, Pendulum and Synchro cards.** 
- To give the oldschool Yugioh feel.
5. **Randomize the duel Arenas?** 
- Also a folder for custom ones, as they are simple pictures.
6. **A way to connect/disconnect specific characters being randomized to their own decks.**
- For example, if a Yugi deck was randomized into a spot, should the Yugi Avatar images be 
placed onto the character that uses it?
7. **Randomize the Card Packs in the shop.**
- Sure, it's about 800 cards per card pack, but they have a general theme with a few randoms 
thrown into them, for example, without actually proof-checking I can tell you that 
Joeys pack will probably always have the Red-Eyes Black Dragon in it.
- The picture on the packs seem to use "Dialog Chars" pictures, **Grandpa Muto Booster Pack** 
for example uses the *solomonmuto_smile.png*. Maybe there is a pointer that can be changed, 
to point to a random image.
8. **Randomize the Duelist Pictures.** 
- With option to allow custom ones, while they don't require specific image sizes, 
it should be mentioned that they should be between specific sizes, to not make it look 
too weird in game. This option would also further change the Booster Pack images.
9. **Archetype Deck Randomization** 
- There are various decks that build around 1 or even 2 archetypes, for example, 
a 10 card combo that is based on Exodia or Red-Eyes Black Dragon, cards that combo really well 
off of each other, those could be set to be randomized together at times, could be a neat way 
to randomize or even increase the difficulty.
10. **Price for Card Packs** 
- So I feel like the 200 per Card Pack is VERY little, so my idea would be to randomize 
the prices to 1000-2000 or so, as one can get more than 1000 per duel, and being able to build 
an entire **new** deck after playing *even when losing* **1** Match, just seems very broken. 
A winning match at the start of the game (don't remember if it changes) can give 1000-1500 points.
